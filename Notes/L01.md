# What is Course About?
1. Cool maths
1. Not cryptocurrency
1. Not computer security
1. Not blockchains

# Course Contents
1. Foundations of real world digital systems
1. Formal security definitons and security proofs
1. Theoretical course

# Objectives
1. Develop 'crypto mindset'
1. Modelling threats via security definitions
1. Learn the 'atomic' building blocks of crypto
1. Understand how to prove security

# 4-Step Recipe for a Crypto Primitive
1. Define security for primitive
1. Figure out required building blocks
1. Propose construction
1. Prove construction satisfies security definitions

**(any) Theorem**: Assuming building blocks $\exists$ construction satisfying the definition

Issue with this:

1. Building block itself could be broken
1. Security definition might be incomplete

## Building blocks are analogous with lego blocks :)
1. Blocks are immutable $\equiv$ DO NOT modify building blocks
1. Can't manufacture blocks $\equiv$ DO NOT implement building blocks

# Why Formal Definitions?

## Symmetric Key Encryption
Key space: $\mathbb{K}$
$$encrypt(message, key) \to ciphertext$$
$$decrypt(ciphertext, key) \to message | \bot$$
**Correctness**: $decrypt(encrypt(m, k), k) == m$

## What Needs to be Ensured?
1. Adversary should not be able to learn any part of $m$
1. (??) Probability distribution does not change

## Messed Up Ciphers in History
1. Caesar's cipher - brute force
1. Substitution cipher - frequency analysis
1. Vigenere's cipher - brute force on $n$ + substitution cipher algo
    i. secret key = $n$ different permutations
    i. encryption = encode $i^{th}$ character with $i\mod n^{th}$ permutation
    i. Is double encrypt Vignere secure? - NO. Since it is just a new permutation
    i. Is Vignere with $n = |m|$? - NO. Unless it is used only once
1. (rotor machines) Enigma
1. Shannon's One-Time Pad - first perfectly secure algorithm
    - key cannot be re-used
    - key must be as large as message
1. Date Encryption Standards (DES)
    i. key space = $\{0, 1\}^{56}$
    i. encrypts/decrypts $64$ bit blocks at a time
    i. $56$ was chosen since US had powerful computers and they could brute-force and decode but not others
1. Double DES (2DES)
    i. key space = $\{0, 1\}^{112}$
    i. performs DES twice on $64$ bit blocks
    i. previous attakcs infeasible
    i. a different (very simple) attack breaks 2DES (which also breaks DES)
1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
    i. key space = $\{0, 1\}^{128}$
    i. encrypts/decrypts $128$ bit blocks at a time
    i. no efficient algorithm for breaking AES

# Building Blocks
Hard computation problems are building blocks

## Sources
1. Cryptographic standards: AES, SHA, etc.
1. Number theory
1. Geometry
1. Combinatorics

#Misc
We'll only see tip of iceberg of crypto

# Crypto is Magic!

## Magic 1 - Oblivious transfer
1. Bob should learn $x_b$ ($b$ is a bit)
1. Alice should not learn $b$
1. Bob should not learn $x_{1-b}$

## Magic 2 - Multiparty computation
1. Alice and Bob should learn $f(x_0, x_1)$
1. Alice should not learn $x_1$
1. Bob should not learn $x_0$

## Magic 3 - Zero Knowledge Proof
1. Convince that solutions exists
1. Don't reveal solution

# Course Policy
1. Theoretical proofs
1. LaTeX assignments
1. Minor - 25
1. Major - 30
1. Assignments (4) - 25
1. Quizzes (best 5 of 6) - 20 (non-surprise, during class hours)
1. (?) Open-notes but handwritten only :(
1. (?) Longer duration for exams?
1. Three late days cumulative for assignments
1. Audit - 30% cumulative and 30% in exams
