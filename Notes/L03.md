- $x \leftarrow S\implies x\text{ is uniformly chosen from }S$
- $|C|\geq|M|$ since inverse (partial) function exists
- $K$ is sampled uniformly

# Relation Between $|K|$ and $|M|$
1. To ensure that the definition of perfect indistinguishability holds, $|\{k_i | enc(m, k_i) = c\}|$ should be independent of $m$ for each $c$
1. Therefore, we should have at least cardinality of the above set times the number of keys as the message space
1. In general, we can say that $|K| \geq |M|$
1. This is terrible news :(

# Shannon's OTP's Limitations
1. Each key can only be used only once
1. Russians used OTP for encryption and this was cracked
1. Malleability attacks (why is sir good at remembering names?)
    - can find out $\tilde m$

# Practical Encryption Schemes - $|K| < |M|$
1. Use a deterministic function such that if input is random, then output "looks" random
1. Allow for $\epsilon$ error in probability

Above two won't work. Instead, we try to provide security against polynomial time adversaries.

## Security Game
Given two messages $m_0, m_1$ by adversary, challenger picks a random bit $b$ and a random key $k$. Challenger gives $enc(m_b, k)$ and the adversary has to identify $b$ 'efficiently' (polynomial time) correctly with probability $\leq \frac{1}{2}$ (only equality will hold otherwise, we can have an adversary which can guess the opposite of an adversary that has $< 1/2$ leading to contradiction).

# Questions
1. Relation Between $|K|$ and $|C|$ (my thoughts: can't say anything)
1. Come up with a definition for two time security
