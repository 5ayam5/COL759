# PRGs are One Way Functions ):)
In polynomial time

If we have a secure encryption scheme which is secure against key recovery attacks, then we can generate PRGs as:

$$f_m = enc(m, k)$$

One way functions imply PRGs. PRGs imply pretty much everything else. So one way functions are the most fundamental building blocks in cryptography.

# AES
1. Practical implementation of one way function
1. $AES:\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$, $\forall k$, $AES(x, k)$ is a permutation
1. $AES^{-1}:\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}^n$, $\forall k$, $AES^{-1}(AES(x, k)) = x$
