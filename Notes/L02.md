# Recap
Saying that AES, SHA etc are building blocks doesn't make sense since it isn't a computational problem but a function

# Off Topic

## When does Computational Problem become Suitable for Crypto?
Confidence over time - no solution for long

## When does a Computational Problem become NP-Complete?
1. Find reduction from problem to a well known problem
1. It is difficult to compare difficulty of different problems

# Attempt to Formalize Definition
Adversary should know encryption and decryption function to strengthen the definition

## Adversary should not be able to learn message (given cipher text)
1. $\forall\text{adversary}:$
$$\underset{k\in\mathbb{K}, m\in\mathbb{D}}{P}[A(enc(m, k)) = m] \leq \frac{1}{|m|}$$
doesn't capture language-ness
1. $\forall\text{adversary}: \forall\text{distribution }D\text{ over }M$
$$\underset{k\in\mathbb{K}, m\in\mathbb{M}}{P}[A(enc(m, k)) = m] \leq \underset{x\in M}{\min}\underset{m\in D}{P}[m = x]$$
min does not work since some message might have 0 probability or something
1. $\forall\text{adversary}: \forall\text{distribution }D\text{ over }M$
$$\underset{k\in\mathbb{K}, m\in\mathbb{M}}{P}[A(enc(m, k)) = m] \leq \underset{x\in M}{\max}\underset{m\in D}{P}[m = x]$$

## Adversary should not be able to learn any predicate on message (given cipher text)
$\forall\text{adversary}: \forall\text{distribution }D\text{ over }M:$
$$\forall\text{predicate }\phi: \underset{k\in\mathbb{K}, m\in\mathbb{M}}{P}[A(enc(m, k)) = \phi(m)] \leq \underset{b\in \phi(M)}{\max}\underset{m\in D}{P}[b = \phi(m)]$$

## Probability Distribution of Message doesn't Change even after seeing Encryption
$\forall\text{ distribution }D: \forall x\in M: \forall c \in C$
$$\underset{m\in D}{P}[m = x] = \underset{m\in D, k\in K}{P}[m = x | enc(m, k) = c]$$
Example: see Shannon OTP

## Perfect Indistinguishability
$$\forall m_0, m_1 \in M, c\in C: \underset{k\in K}{P}[enc(m_0, k) = c] = \underset{k \in K}{P}[enc(m_1, k) = c]$$

# Shannon One Time Pad
$$M = K = C = \{0, 1\}^n$$
$$enc(m, k) = m\oplus k$$
$$dec(c, k) = c\oplus k$$

## Does it Satisfy Definition 3?
$D =$ uniform over $M$
$$\underset{m\in D}{P}[m = x] = \frac{1}{|M|}$$
$$\forall c\in C: \underset{m\in D, k\in K}P[m = x | m\oplus k = c] = \frac{1}{|M|}$$
Yes, it satisfies definition!

## Does it Satisfy Definition 4?
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[enc(m, k) = c] = \frac{1}{|K|}$$
Yes!

# Exercise - for a coffee
Compare the first three definitions and show equivalence or strength of definitions
