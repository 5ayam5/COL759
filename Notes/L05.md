1. Students will be given chits
1. Need to write about what is not clear
1. Summarize the lecture

# Solution for Q04.02
Solve using contrapositive. Let us assume that there is an adversary $A$ that can break $E'$. We now construct $B$ that breaks $E$.

Algorithm:

1. $B$ forwards $m_0, m_1$ received from $A$
1. $B$ then sends $(ct, ct)$ to $A$
1. $B$ returns output of $b$ received from $A$

*Above approach won't work (think why)*

## Hint
Construct two worlds:

1. World 0 - challenger encrypts $m_0$
1. World 1 - challenger encrypts $m_1$

Claim: Adversary won't behave differently in the two worlds


# Construction for Secure Encryption Schemes - Examples
$$K = \{0, 1\}^n, M = \{0, 1\}^l, l > n$$
$$enc(m, k) = m\oplus G(k)$$
$G$ is a public function which is efficiently computable

## Examples of $G$
1. $G(s) = ss$
1. $G(s) :$ xor of bits of $G(s) = 0$

Both can be broken with $m_0 = 0\ldots 0, m_1 = 0\ldots 01$. Therefore, if output of $G$ is sufficiently different from random, then encryption breaks.

## Formulating 'Looks Random' using Game
1. Challenger chooses a bit $b$, $s$, $u_0 = G(s), $u_1 = U$
1. Adversary guesses $b$

## What are some Attacks on $E_G$
1. Malleability
1. Using the key multiple times

# Issues with using Time in the Key
The keys are not independent, therefore, can be broken
