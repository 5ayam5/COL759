# (Final) Solution to Question 04.02
Consider probabilities $p_0$ and $p_1$ such that adversary guesses $0$ in world $0$ and $1$ respectively. Consider hybrid world where $(enc(m_0, k_1), enc(m_1, k_2))$ is sent, let the probability of guessing $0$ is $p_h$.

We have two cases for $p_h$:

## Case 1
$$|p_h - p_0| = \delta$$
$B$ sends $(enc(m_0, k_1), ct)$. If $p_h$ is larger, then we guess $\neg{\hat{b}}$ else $\hat{b}$, where $\hat{b}$ is the guess of $A$.

## Case 2
$$|p_h - p_1| = \delta$$
$B$ sends $(ct, enc(m_0, k_2))$. If $p_h$ is larger, then we guess $\neg{\hat{b}}$ else $\hat{b}$, where $\hat{b}$ is the guess of $A$.

# Security of $E_G$
Assume that $\exists A$ which breaks $E_G$, then $\exists B$ which breaks $G$ (assuming $E$ is secure)
