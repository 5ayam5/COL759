# Recap of Last 3-4 Lectures
1. $E = (keygen, enc, dec)$
1. Equivalence between bit-guessing and two world formulation
    - $P[\text{A wins}] \leq \frac{1}{2} + \mu(n)$
    - $p_0 - p_1 \leq \mu'(n)$
    - $\mu(n) = \frac{\mu'(n)}{2}$
1. PRG game

*sir will write this in detail in the PDF notes*

# Given a Candidate $G$, Check that $G$ is a (computationally) secure PRG
1. Prove security definition (not that easy, we don't know about all $A$)
1. Proving that inverse computation takes large amount of time (??)
1. Solving this will prove $P \neq NP$
1. We can rely on building blocks - we don't directly use them to build an encryption scheme since PRG is a clean object to build

*xor is such an interesting function - can mangle data without destroying it*

# Proof of $E_G$ being secure if $G$ is secure
We assume that there exists an adversary $A$ which breaks $E_G$. Now, we have $p_0 - p_1 = \delta$. We consider the two hybrid worlds where Hybrid-$b$ encodes $m_b$ with $r \in \{0, 1\}^l$. For either case, $p_h$ is the same since we are working on OTP (it should also work with a similar idea for a non OTP scheme).

# Something More Fun (:eyes fun is sus)
*sir gave some hints about this when I went to ask him the doubt(s)*

$$G : \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^{n+1}$$
$G$ is parameterised by $a_i\in[0, 2^{n+1} - 1], i\in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$
$$G(x) = (\sum_{1\leq i\leq n}a_i\cdot x_i)\mod 2^{n+1}$$
This is average case subset sum problem (average since it depends on choice of $a_i$'s)

## Question: can we extend Range to $\{0, 1\}^l$
Inductively, yes:

$$G': \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^{n+2}$$
$$y_1y_2\ldots y_ny_{n+1} = G(x)$$
$$G'(x) = G(y_1\ldots y_n)y_{n+1}$$
