# Q1
$$M = \{0, 1\}^n = K, C = \{0, 1\}^{n+1}$$
$$enc(m, k) = (m\oplus k, <m, k>\mod 2)$$
**Show that this encryption scheme violates the $3^{rd}$ definition.**

Solution: Take $D = U$, $m = 0^n$, $c = 0^n1$. Now, the RHS is 0 but the conditional has non zero probability. Hence, proved.

# Q2
**Show equivalence between $3^{rd}$ and $4^{th}$ definition.**

Solution:

($\implies$) Assume by contradiction that definition $4$ does not hold for some $m_0 = a$, $m_1 = b$ and $c = c_0$. We now show a distribution $D$, message $x$ and cipher text $c$ such that the definition $3$ fails.

($\Longleftarrow$) Start with RHS of definition $3$ and arrive at LHS of the definition. We use the fact that all $P[enc(m_i, k)]$ are equal to complete the result.

# Q3
**Show equivalence between Security Game and $4^{th}$ definition**

Solution:

($\implies$) Can formally write game as
$$\underset{k\in K, b\in\{0, 1\}}{P}[A\text{ wins game}] = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$\implies\underset{k\in K, b\in\{0, 1\}}{P}[A(enc(m_b, k)) = b] = \frac{1}{2}$$
Since $b$ is uniformly and independently sampled, we get,
$$\implies\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 0]\times P[b = 0] + \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 1]\times P[b = 1] = \frac{1}{2}$$
$$\implies\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 0] + \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 1] = 1$$

Similarly, since probability of losing is $1/2$, we get,
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 1] + \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 0] = 1$$

We also know the following,
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 0] + \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 1] = 1$$
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 0] + \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 1] = 1$$

Subtracting appropriate equations,
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 0] = \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 0]$$
$$\underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_0, k)) = 1] = \underset{k\in K}{P}[A(enc(m_1, k)) = 1]$$

# Q4
$$M = \{0, 1\}^l, K = \{0, 1\}^n, l > n$$
$$enc(m, k) = m\oplus G(k), G : \{0, 1\}^n\to \{0, 1\}^l$$
**Show that this scheme is not perfectly secure/indistinguishable.**

Solution:

Can be done by taking $m_0, m_1, c$ appropriately such that $G$ reveals some information about exactly one of the two thus changing probabilities.
